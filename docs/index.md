## Supported Redis Data Types

- **String**: View and edit string values, including binary data
- **List**: Browse list items with pagination and edit/delete list items
- **Set**: View set members and delete
- **Hash**: Display hash fields and values in a table format. Ability to edit hash values and delete hash entries.
- **Sorted Set**: Show sorted set members with scores. Able to delete set members and edit scores.

### Binary Data Handling

Django Redis Panel safely handles binary data stored in Redis:

- **Automatic Detection**: Binary data that can't be decoded using the configured encoding format (utf-8 by default) is automatically displayed as bytes literals (strings like `b'...'`)
- **Editable Format**: Binary values appear as `b'...'` or `b"..."` and can be edited directly in this format. User this method whenever you want to make edits without encoding data.
- **Common Use Cases**: Though not perfect, this allows you to inspect objects with formats such as pickle or MessagePack. It is also useful in environments where there is a mixed set of encoding formats being used
